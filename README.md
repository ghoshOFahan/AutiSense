> **Privacy-first, browser-based autism screening powered by on-device AI.**

AutiSense is a web application that captures behavioral biomarkers using real-time on-device AI inference. Four ONNX models run entirely in the browser -- no video, audio, or inference data ever leaves the device during screening. Cloud services enrich the experience with generative AI reports, text-to-speech, and cross-device data sync, all with graceful offline fallbacks.

## Key Features

- **10-step screening pipeline** -- Guided flow covering consent, speech, motor, reaction time, and full behavioral video analysis (~15 minutes)
- **On-device AI inference** -- YOLO pose detection, body/face behavior classification, and emotion analysis run client-side via Web Workers and ONNX Runtime Web
- **Multimodal fusion** -- Body pose (70%) and facial expression (30%) late fusion for ASD risk scoring
- **AI-generated clinical reports** -- Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro) produces DSM-5-aligned reports with severity mapping; downloadable as PDF
- **Kids dashboard** -- 13 therapy games, AI chat with animated animal avatars, speech practice, progress tracking, weekly reports, and a nearby-institutes map
- **Offline-first** -- IndexedDB (Dexie v5) stores all data locally; DynamoDB sync when connectivity is available
- **Privacy-first** -- Zero data egress during screening; cloud sync is opt-in with explicit consent

## Kids Dashboard and Therapy Games

The kids dashboard (`/kid-dashboard`) provides 13 therapy games across two hubs, daily streak tracking, AI chat, speech practice, weekly reports, and a nearby-institutes map.

**Clinician-facing games (7):**
Emotion Quiz, Category Sorting, Sequence Memory, Social Stories, Calm Breathing, Pattern Match, Color and Sound

**Kid-facing games (6):**
Bubble Pop, Alphabet Pattern, Tracing, Match Numbers, Memory, Social Stories V2

All games use an adaptive difficulty engine that adjusts based on recent score history. Game activity and daily streaks are tracked in IndexedDB.

Additional features: AI chat with animal avatars (dog/cat/rabbit/parrot), speech practice with Polly TTS, weekly progress reports (kid and parent views), nearby autism institutes map (Leaflet + Overpass API, 50+ institutes across 12 Indian cities).

## Privacy Architecture

AutiSense follows a **zero-egress screening** model:

1. **On-device inference** -- All 4 AI models (YOLO, BodyTCN, FER+, FaceTCN) run in a Web Worker via ONNX Runtime Web. No video frames, keypoints, or inference results are transmitted to any server.
2. **Local-first storage** -- All screening data lives in IndexedDB (Dexie). The app works fully offline.
3. **Opt-in cloud sync** -- An explicit consent checkbox at Step 10 controls whether anonymized biomarker scores are synced to DynamoDB. Child names are stripped before upload.
4. **Cloud AI enrichment** -- Only aggregated biomarker scores (not raw data) are sent to Amazon Bedrock for report generation. This step is optional and has template-based fallbacks.
5. **Data expiry** -- DynamoDB records have a 365-day TTL and auto-expire.

## AWS Services

| Service | Purpose | Region |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Amazon Bedrock** | Nova Lite (chat, word generation, summaries) + Nova Pro (DSM-5 clinical reports) | us-east-1 |
| **Amazon Polly** | Neural TTS voice prompts (Joanna) | ap-south-1 |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | 7 tables -- users, auth sessions, screening sessions, biomarkers, feed posts, child profiles, session summaries | ap-south-1 |
| **AWS Amplify** | WEB_COMPUTE SSR hosting with auto-deploy from GitHub | ap-south-1 |
| **Amazon S3** | ONNX model storage (models currently served from `public/` via CDN) | ap-south-1 |
| **AWS IAM** | 1 user + 1 role + scoped Bedrock/Polly/DynamoDB policies | Global |
| **AWS Budgets** | $10/month alarm with email alerts at 80% | Global |

All AWS-dependent API routes have **graceful fallbacks** -- the app is fully functional without AWS credentials.

See [`docs/Amazon_usage.md`](docs/Amazon_usage.md) for the complete AWS architecture reference.

## Deployment

AutiSense is deployed on **AWS Amplify** (WEB_COMPUTE) with auto-deploy from the `main` branch.

```bash
# Manual trigger
aws amplify start-job --app-id d2n7pu2vtgi8yc --branch-name main --job-type RELEASE --region ap-south-1
```

### Amplify SSR Environment Variables

Amplify WEB_COMPUTE injects env vars into the build container but **not** into the Lambda runtime. All non-AWS env vars are listed in `next.config.ts` under the `env` property for build-time inlining. AWS credentials use `APP_*` prefix (Amplify reserves the `AWS_*` prefix).

See [`docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md) for full deployment configuration, troubleshooting, and the list of all 16 required Amplify environment variables.
