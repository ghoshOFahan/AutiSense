We recommend a comprehensive developmental evaluation by:
   - A developmental pediatrician
   - A clinical psychologist specializing in autism assessment
   - A multidisciplinary team using standardized diagnostic instruments (ADOS-2, ADI-R)

2. EARLY INTERVENTION: Regardless of diagnostic outcome, early intervention services may support your child's development:
   - Speech-language therapy (if communication differences noted)
   - Occupational therapy (for motor and sensory processing support)
   - Applied behavior analysis (ABA) or naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions (NDBI)

3. MONITORING: Continue monitoring developmental milestones and repeat screening in 3-6 months to track progress.` : `1. CONTINUE MONITORING: Current screening scores are within the typical range. Continue monitoring developmental milestones at regular pediatric visits.

2. RESCREEN: Consider repeating this screening in 6-12 months or if new concerns arise.

3. WELL-CHILD VISITS: Maintain regular pediatric check-ups and discuss any emerging concerns with your child's doctor.`}
