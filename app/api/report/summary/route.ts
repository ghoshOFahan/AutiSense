- Use warm, supportive language appropriate for parents
- Explain what each score means in plain language
- Reference DSM-5 Criterion A (Social Communication & Interaction) and Criterion B (Restricted & Repetitive Behaviours) where relevant
- End with a clear recommendation for next steps
- Do NOT use the word "diagnosis" -- this is a screening tool, not a diagnostic instrument`;
